# Requirements & Specifications
As can be seen via a quick glance of the [README](../README.md) file, this is a project of relatively reasonable complexity, with the tech stack making use of multiple programming languages, frameworks, APIs and and libraries which are all used to varying degrees in the Front-end, Back-end and Database development. The project as a whole has been split up into multiple smaller tasks and subsystems (primarily for convenience of development) into the following: Interactive Heat Maps, Image Upload Functionality, Comparitive Analysis Tools, Educational Resources, Downloadable Reports and Summaries.
